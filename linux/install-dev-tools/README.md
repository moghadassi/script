 # All-in-One Development & Networking Tools Installer

This script installs a comprehensive set of **development tools**, **C#/.NET**, **Java**, **networking utilities**, **Docker**, and **VS Code** on Ubuntu-based systems.  
It is designed to be **resumable**, meaning if the installation is interrupted, you can re-run the script and it will continue installing only the missing or partially installed packages.
